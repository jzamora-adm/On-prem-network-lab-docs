# Network & On-Premises Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my personal lab documentation repository. This project showcases hands-on experience with networking fundamentals, Windows Server administration, and the beginning stages of cloud adoption via Microsoft Azure.

## Lab Overview

This lab environment reflects my ongoing effort to advance into roles involving system administration, hybrid cloud technologies, and deeper technical ownership beyond traditional help desk support.

### On-Premises Setup

#### **Juniper EX2200 Switch**
- VLAN configuration and segmentation
- DHCP configuration via routing-instances
- Static routing and L3 interface configuration

#### **Windows Server 2022 (Hyper-V VM)**
- Promoted to a Domain Controller (Active Directory)
- DNS server configured and working within a private VLAN
- Hosted on a VLAN-tagged Hyper-V virtual machine

### Azure Exploration (In Progress)
- Currently working through the Microsoft Learn AZ-104 course
- Spun up temporary VNets and VMs for lab modules
- Planning future hybrid integration with on-prem environment

## Planned Improvements
- Add a second Windows Server VM to join the domain
- Configure Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Set up Azure AD Connect for hybrid identity testing
- Explore VPN options between on-prem and Azure VNet

## Goals
- Document a real-world environment from switch config to cloud
- Demonstrate initiative and continuous learning to potential employers
- Prepare for Azure administrator roles with a solid hybrid foundation
